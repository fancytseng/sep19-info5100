II. Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList. (Score 1)

- ArrayList and LinkedList both implement List interface.
- ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements, which meansArrayList is a resizable array.
We can fix the length later since the length is not fixed. As more elements are added to the ArrayList, its size
increased. Since ArrayList is essentially an Array, we can simply/directly use get and set method to access/get the
elements in the ArrayList. ArrayList is sorted sequentially.
- LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. Its performance on add and remove is better than ArrayList,
 but worse on get and set methods.
- ArrayList is better for sorting and accessing data(set/get method). LinkedList is better for manipulating data(add/remove)
method.
- Space Complexity: LinkedList < ArrayList
- Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array,
 all the bits are shifted in memory. However, for LinkedList, we only add and remove one link every time.
