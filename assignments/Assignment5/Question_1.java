    //Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8.

    /*
    Final: It is done. It cannot be changed.
        If the parents are final method, then the children cannot change the method.
        If one class is final, then no other classes can extend that class.
        Final class can't be inherited.
        If made data final, then it cannot be modified.
        Final variable value can't be changed.
        Method with final scope can't be overridden in child class.
        It is a keyword.

    Finally: It is a piece of code that always perform, even you have an exception.
        We use finally if we have something that we really need to do.
        Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
        It is a block.
